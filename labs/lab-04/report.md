# Lab 04 Report - Licensing  

## Why is it important to choose a license  

It is important to choose a license because it ensures that all 4 freedoms are respected and followed. The license allows users of the software to have the necessary freedoms to consider the software free. Otherwise, the software would only be "free" to the developer.

## Why is it important that you shouldnt use a project that doesnt have an explicit license  

You should not use a project that does not have an explicit license because there is nothing stating that the software is free and can be used by users. Without this, the developer technically owns the software and it is not free and can pursue possible law suits or other forms of punishment for using their software. Licenses prevent this from happening and allow users to use the software freely. 

## Opinions on the claim 



## Justify why license is chosen based on history, goals and philosophy of the project?   

Linux is justified in choosing the GPL v2 license because it allows the source code for the kernel to always be available. It also does not require that the code to be distributed free of charge. The original vision of Linux from its creators was that the code be available and that there did not have to be money involved at all [Tozzi](https://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2016/08/23/linus-torvalds-early-linux-history-gpl-license-money). Linux first used its own license but then switched to GPL which allowed them to follow their original vision.
